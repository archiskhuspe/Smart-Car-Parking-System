# Smart-Car-Parking-System

ðŸ’« Introduction

Our project ensures to find free parking places for the public. As soon as a parking spot is empty in the parking lot, it is detected using ultrasonic sensors that report it further. The number of available slots is then shown on the LCD screen near the entry point of the parking that the drivers can refer to. This feature saves the time and fuel required to search for the parking slot.

ðŸ’« Concept

The plan is to implement a system in which the presence of a car can be detected using an ultrasonic sensor, and the slots available will be displayed on 16x2 LCD. When the car is at the entry point, the driver will be supposed to give input at the entry point, with the help of a push-button, enabling him to open the servo motor and eventually allow him to park the car.

ðŸ’« Specifications

Arduino is an open-source hardware and software company, project and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices. Servo motors or â€˜servosâ€™, as they are known, are electronic devices and rotary or linear actuators that rotate and push parts of a machine with precision. Servos are mainly used in angular or linear positions and for specific velocity and acceleration. An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal.

ðŸ’« Working

When an individual wants to park car in the parking first, he is supposed to push the button which will open the servo motor here which is functioning as a gate. The driver is directed to parking slot where the ultrasonic sensor will sense the presence of free slot if so,  the driver will be notified of free space with the help of LCD display.
